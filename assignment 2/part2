A good way to improve the performance of the code would be to use a cache
The cache is there to reduce the number of times the CPU would stall waiting
for a memory request to be fulfilled, and as a second effect, possibly to reduce
the overall amount of data that needs to be transfered. The setup would be, search
the word, open the cache, does the word exist in cache, IF TRUE, read cache and
print out, ELSE, search inside db.txt.
